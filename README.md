# MAKE-MY-TRIP
Hi everyone, I'm sharing my data analysis project on hotel and city data from MakeMyTrip. I analyzed 580 hotel records using SQL, focusing on factors like hotel price, tax, reviews, and revenue. I used MySQL Server and Workbench for analysis and visualization. The goal was to identify key business insights and optimize operations.
